# Font File Placeholder

## Sage Font Requirement

This project requires the "sage.otf" font file to be placed in the root directory for the wedding invitation to display correctly with the Sage font for the couple's names.

**Important:** The actual sage.otf font file needs to be added to this directory for the font to work properly.

Without the font file, the website will fall back to Georgia serif font.
